# ABREATH Breathalyzer

The breathalyzer app will give the user their alcohol breath levels upon blowing into a machine containing an Analog Alcohol Sensor (MQ3). The results will be displayed on the application that will read the sensor and will give a decision whether the person who blew into the breathalyzer can or cannot take the wheel. It will display the accurate results on the screen as well.
